# newtons-method
This can solve any equation of the form ax^z+bx+c=0 where z is positive using [newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtons_method)

PRs to make the input to python function process are more robust are very welcome, autograd can then be used for automatic differentation of the python function

## Example valid equation inputs
5x^2+2x-3  
5x^2-2x-3  
5x^2-2x+3  
-5x^2+2x-3  
0x^2+5x-100  
1x^2+0x-20  
## Example invalid euqation inputs
x^2+5x+2 - there must be an a term (at the moment!)  
1x^-1+5x+2 - no negative powers (at the moment!)  
1x^3+1x^2+2 - too many terms (at the moment!)
